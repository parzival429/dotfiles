#these dotfiles are filled with my configs for all sorts of software that i have, including but not limited to
#sway, wofi, starship, qutebrowser, kitty, and fish. 
# all files in this repo are labeled based on what file and what directory you need to put them in to put them into effect.
# no apps will be downloaded, so you will need to find these on your package manager or on github.
# hope i made your software a little better!
